# Etch-A-Sketch
Javascript DOM manipulation, used to create an Etch-A-Sketch

Heavy practice with event listeners and creating html div elements that update through user input

More practice with the idea of scope, and figuring out different ways to pass local variables through into other functions, for the terms of this project, found global variables to be useful as multiple functions relied on the same global variable
    - in the future should limit this practice

additional practice with CSS/design work (buttons, layout, color, etc.), and first time using input html elements
    - overall very simple to implement, however, difficult to fully customize (same with buttons)
